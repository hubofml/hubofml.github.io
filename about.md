"Machine learning is hard,” said a friend.  As much I hate to admit it, I agreed with him two months after.
 
If you are taking your first step into machine learning and data science universe, it might seem like a daunting task, sometimes intimidating. The machine learning community is growing very fast.🚀 There are free, high-quality resources 📚 that can assist your journey to become that guy that teaches computers to learn. The problem is:  these excellent resources are hard to find for beginners. 

I created **hubofml** to collate top-notch links to free materials that I find on the internet on **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **data science** on a weekly basis. These links have been read by humans (no automation work involved), vetted to be spot-on, and useful.

The goal of hubofml is to make getting into machine learning a fun and exciting 🤪 one for you.  You can get involved by suggesting high-quality content that might help others to [hubofml](maito:hubofml@gmail.com).
