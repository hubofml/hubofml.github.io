"Machine learning is hard”, said a friend.  As much I hate to admit it I agreed with him 2 years after.
 
If you are taking your first steps👣into machine learning and data science universe, it might seem like a daunting task, sometimes intimidating. Machine learning community is growing very fast.🚀 There are  free, high quality resources 📚 that can assist your journey to become that guy that teaches computer to learn. The problem is:  these excellent resources are hard to find for beginners. 

I created **hubofml** to collate top notch links to free materials that I find on the internet on **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **data science** on a weekly basis. These links have been read (no automation work involved), vetted to be spot-on and useful.

The goal of hubofml is to make getting in to machine learning a fun and exciting 🤪 one for you. And you too, can get involved by suggesting high quality content to [hubofml](maito:hubofml@gmail.com).
